/// A constant pattern determines if the matched value is equal to the

/// expression forms syntactically overlap other kinds of patterns. We avoid
/// ambiguity while supporting terse forms of the most common constant
/// expressions like so:
/// ...
/// Named constants are also allowed because they aren't ambiguous. That
/// includes simple identifiers like someConstant, prefixed constants like
/// some_library.aConstant, static constants on classes like
/// SomeClass.aConstant, and prefixed static constants like
/// some_library.SomeClass.aConstant. Simple identifiers would be ambiguous with
/// variable patterns that aren't marked with var, final, or a type, but
/// unmarked variable patterns are only allowed in irrefutable contexts where
/// constant patterns are prohibited.
