/// @assertion A generic class declaration introduces a generic class into the 
/// enclosing library scope. A generic class is a mapping that accepts a list of
/// actual type arguments and maps them to a class. Consider a generic class
/// declaration [G] named [C] with formal type parameter declarations [X1 extends
/// B1,..., Xm extends Bm], and a parameterized type [T] of the form
/// [C<T1,..., Tl>].
/// It is a compile-time error if [m != l].
/// @description Checks that compile error is thrown for the case with one type
/// argument
